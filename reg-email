**Subject:** A Heartfelt Goodbye & Thank You  

Dear All,  

As many of you know, today marks my last working day at HSBC HTI. While it’s a bittersweet moment, I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude and share my appreciation for the wonderful journey I’ve had here.  

Working with such bright minds and an incredibly hardworking team has been a privilege. Each one of you has contributed to my learning and growth, and I leave with fond memories of collaboration, innovation, and teamwork.  

A special note of thanks to the leadership for trusting me, appreciating my work, and supporting my decisions. Their guidance has been instrumental in shaping my journey here, and I’m truly grateful for the opportunities I’ve had to contribute.  

To my peers – thank you for the camaraderie, support, and the occasional laughter that helped us power through challenges. The tea breaks, brainstorming sessions, and long discussions will be missed (especially the tea breaks!).  

While I may be leaving HSBC, I’m only a message away. Please do stay in touch:  
- **Phone/WhatsApp:** [Your Number]  
- **LinkedIn:** [Your Profile Link]  

It’s been an incredible chapter, and I look forward to hearing about all the great things this team will continue to achieve. Until we cross paths again, I wish you all success and happiness, both personally and professionally.  

Warm regards,  
[Your Full Name]
