To build an effective **Epic Burndown** visualization in Looker Studio, we should break it down into multiple insights. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### **1. Core Metrics to Display**
- **Total Story Points in Epic/Release**
- **Total Story Points Remaining**
- **Epic Progress % (Burndown Formula)**
- **Epic Start Date & Target End Date**
- **Remaining Days in Epic**

### **2. Visualizations**
- **Epic Burndown Line Chart:**  
  - X-axis: Days in Epic  
  - Y-axis: Story Points Remaining  
  - Shows how work is progressing over time.

- **Epic Progress Bar:**  
  - % Completion of the Epic  
  - Color indicators (Red: Behind schedule, Yellow: At Risk, Green: On Track)

- **Epic Story Point Breakdown Pie Chart:**  
  - Completed vs. Remaining Story Points  
  - Helps identify the proportion of work left.

- **Epic Risk Indicator Table:**  
  - Lists Epics that are behind schedule  
  - Based on remaining story points vs. time left
